**Predicting risk of Stroke in patients using Data from EHRs**

**Motivation**

Stroke is the leading cause of disability in US.80% of strokes can be prevented and 58% of Americans donâ€™t know if they are at risk.

The main aim of my project is to to use NLP to analyze the medical records and predict the risk of stroke in patients.I plan to use the MIMIC-III data (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care), a large, single-center database comprising information relating to patients admitted to critical care units at a large tertiary care hospital.

**Part 1**

The  MIMIC-III database includes 26 tables.I plan to focus on 3 tables - the NOTEEVENTS (including nursing and physician notes, ECG reports, radiology reports, and discharge summaries), DIAGNOSES_ICD (Hospital assigned diagnoses, coded using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) system) and D_DIAGNOSES_ICD (Dictionary of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-9) codes relating to diagnoses) tables. After data cleaning and processing, I will extract the records that are labeled as stroke and non-stroke based on the ICD9 code and the patients' past medical, social and history information. Then I will combine medical records for stroke patients and ( randomly sampled) records for non-stroke patients for cosine similarity and component analysis.I then plan to apply the principle component analysis  to visulize the how stroke and non-stroke samples are separated.

**Part 2e**

I then plan to apply different prediction models (LogisticRegression ,Support Vector Machine classifier etc )  to predict the diagnosis of stroke. I plan to follow the following steps: 

1) split the data into train data and test data
2) use NLP  to transform text notes, 
3) perform lasso feature selection using linear support vector classifier, 
4) optimize the LogisticRegression and Support Vector Machine classifiers,
5) compare the performance of the classifiers 

**Part 3**

I then plan to build an app to predict the risk of stroke. Health insurance company may use this tool to perform prescreen, save lives and decreased costs.
